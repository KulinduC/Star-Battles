# Star-Battles
Star Battle is a binary determination puzzle where the position of stars located in a grid must be determined. The objective is to paint stars in each shape, 
row and column, subject to the following rules:

1)  The number of stars in each shape, row and column is equal to the number given.
2)  Stars cannot touch vertically, horizontally or diagonally.

This is a recursive program to solve all permutations of an n by m grid. The runtime would increase exponentially with more stars, zones and larger grids inputted.
